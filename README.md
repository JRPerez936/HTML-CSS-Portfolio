# WK2C-Portfolio

This is a website containing my portfolio. It has been designed after the mockup shown and contains multiple functions.
On the header there are links to each section of my portfolio that when clicked will take you to them. In the work section
there are projects listed that would take you to completed project webpages. Currently the only Project that is developed is run-buddy,
so it is the only working link, the rest are placeholders. At the bottom of the page there are links with my contact info. 

Below is an example of what the website looks like: <br />
